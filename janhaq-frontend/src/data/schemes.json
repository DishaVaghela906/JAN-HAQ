    "details": "Promotion of the product of Micro and Small Entrepreneurs is one of the major objectives of the Corporation. In the present competitive scenario a need has been felt to facilitate Micro and Small Enterprises to market their goods / services individually or collectively through ‘Consortium’.

This scheme will especially help the units to enlist themselves for participating in Govt. /private tenders. Special features of the Scheme: The scheme will cover Micro & Small Enterprises registered with National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) under its Single Point Registration Scheme (SPRS). It would also cover Micro & Small Enterprises who apply to get themselves registered with NSIC under the SPRS along with all required documents in terms of the scheme and their factory is inspected before filing of tender in terms of the Tender Marketing Scheme. The scheme shall not cover unit(s) engaging in ‘trading activities’ without value addition/packing/ branding. The scheme also covers the method of selection of the units for participation in the open tenders and single tenders on nomination basis. The scheme takes cares of providing Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) and security deposit on back to back basis. The scheme inter alia includes the procedures for formation of Consortium, Capacity Building of MSEs by formation of consortia of the units manufacturing similar products, participation in tenders on behalf of units in a ‘consortia’ to secure orders in ‘bulk’ quantities, distribution of orders amongst units in a ‘consortia’ as per their capacities, facilitate the ‘consortia’ members in meeting their raw materials requirements & facilitating ‘Credit’ for the supplies made. To accommodate provisions of this scheme, the legal document such as individual agreement by the units, agreement to be executed by the consortium, board resolution, power of attorney and other related document have been revised and simplified.

    "details": "AICTE has decided to establish IDEA (Idea Development, Evaluation & Application) Lab in AICTE approved institutions, encouraging students for application of science, technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) fundamentals towards enhanced hands-on experience, learning by doing and even product visualization. As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to “engage, explore, experience, express and excel” as desired by the Hon'ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020, Purpose: The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to. The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials. Proposal: As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc. The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal. Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE. Implementation: The college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires: An area of 5000 sq. ft. Should ideally remain open 24x7. To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem. To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.

    "details": "The scheme “Arun Pig Development Scheme” was launched by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Veterinary & Dairy Development, Government of Arunachal Pradesh in the financial year 2019-20 with a focus on pig rearing. Among the livestock species, the pig finds an important place as it is being reared by socio-economically weaker sections of the society especially in the states like Arunachal Pradesh where most of people prefer non-veg cuisines with special attractions for Pork. The pig as compared to other livestock species has a great potential to contribute to a faster economic return to the farmers, because of certain inherent traits like high fecundity, better-feed conversion efficiency, early maturity, and short generation interval. Pig farming also requires small investments in buildings and equipment. Objective Genetic improvement of the indigenous pigs of Arunachal Pradesh for productivity enhancement by crossbreeding with the exotic breed(s) to a desired level of combination of exotic and local inheritance, Improvement of indigenous pig rearing by the rural people by selective breeding, Livelihood earning Maintenance of well-planned crossbred animals at farmers’ field Expansion of piggery husbandry and support mechanism to propagate pig rearing in rural areas Ensure that the breeds introduced, and crossbreds produced and propagated in the state are adapted to local environmental conditions and emerging climatic challenges, Strengthen support mechanisms and development of the sector in respect of feeding, housing, and health care besides value addition and marketing of the product with value chain development. Scientific rearing and motivation of farmers for integrated piggery farming.

In border areas, the provision of essential infrastructure facilities and opportunities for sustainable living would help integrate these areas with the hinterland, create a positive perception of care by the country and encourage people to stay on in the border areas, leading to safe and secure borders. ﻿ The following basic principles will guide the implementation of the BADP: a) Projects for developing infrastructure in strategically important villages/towns (as identified by Border Guarding Forces) will be given priority. b) Border Guarding Forces (BGFs) will be co-opted as part of the decision making process at all levels (Planning/ Execution / Monitoring). c) Keeping in view the limited availability of funds under BADS, the State/UT Level Screening Committee (SLSC/UTLSC) will ensure convergence with schemes of line Ministries and State/UT Governments and other available resources to ensure holistic development of the strategically important villages/ towns in the border areas. d) MHA will work in close collaboration with, inter-alia, M/o Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, M/o DoNER, M/o Health & Family Welfare, M/o Human Resource Development, M/o Jai Shakti, M/o New and Renewable Energy, M/o Power, M/o Rural Development, M/o Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, M/o MSME, M/o Women & Child Development, M/o Youth Affairs & Sports etc. to promote infrastructure development, improved connectivity, better social services and to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities in the border areas. e) Works/projects will be evaluated regularly through Social Audit mechanism, besides Prabhari Officers in addition to ongoing mechanisms of State/UT/ Central Governments. f) Saturation / coverage through ongoing developmental schemes of various Ministries of Government of India, if necessary, by relaxation of guidelines and yardsticks with the approval of the competent authority. g) Medium-Term perspective — Four/Five Year Perspective Action Plan would be prepared for development of identified habitations by pooling resources as mentioned in sub clause (c) above. For the subsequent years, the Annual Plan would be drawn up within the overall perspective plan and inclusive of objectives carried forward, modifications necessitated due to lessons learnt and other developments. The Annual Plans would be a subset of the same. For the first year, along with a prospective plan, an annual plan would also be submitted. The States would strive to achieve saturation of beneficiaries and creation of infrastructure under various Government Schemes by 2023. h) Competition among Districts: The Districts would be challenged to compete among themselves on the basis of incremental changes and their performance would be recognized and rewarded. i) Comprehensive Development: For comprehensive development of border districts, BADP will have two components - first will be saturation of beneficiaries and ensuring creation of infrastructure in border districts through convergence of various Government Schemes, and second part will be Border Area Development Scheme(BADS) for convergence and filling up gaps to achieve desired levels of development.",

Registered patients would be provided treatment free of cost at the designated hospitals. On further verification, if it is found that any registered patient is ineligible for assistance, the assistance would be stopped forthwith. Cancer, the killer disease, was once considered incurable. However, advances in medical science have helped conquer the disease to a very large extent. It is scientifically proven that pediatric cases of cancer are largely curable if treated early. Recognizing the urgent need to extend financial support to cancer victims from families, who are too poor to afford treatment, the Government of Kerala launched this scheme. To provide cashless transactions funds have already been deposited with the superintendents of the hospitals. The patients who are eligible for assistance would receive the benefit from these hospitals directly without approaching the Mission. Hospitals Covered under the Scheme: Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Thiruvananthapuram Sree AvitamThirunal (SAT) Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Alapuzha Government Medical College Kottayam Government Medical College Thrissur Government Medical College Kozhikode Co-operative Medical College Pariyaram, Kannur Malabar Cancer Centre, Thalassery, Kannur Government General Hospital, Ernakulam Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Kozhikode Govt.

    "slug": "cmfm",
    "details": "Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal. ﻿ It is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum. It is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.",
